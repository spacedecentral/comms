## Starting an Space Decentral Meetup

In this document we describe the best way to start your local community of Space Decentral using Meetup.com.

The next steps will allow you to create, manage and share a local community, globally. The team from Space Decentral will provide you with additional resources.

**Step 1 - Search for a Meetup in your city**

- Search on Meetup if there is already a Space Decentral Meetup created in your city.
- If there is already one, join it, and ask to be a co-organizer.
- Also, look for Space and Decentralization Meetups and join them.

**Step 2 - Create a Meetup in your city**
- If there is no Space Decentral Meetup on your city, create one for your area, such as "Space Decentral Paris"
- Use the words "Space Decentral" at the beginning of the name, on the URL, description, and tags.
- Use the following generic description:
>Space Decentral is a decentralized community of “Spaciens” or space enthusiasts, encouraging cross-pollination of ideas amongst scientists, engineers, artists, futurists and thinkers that are interested in all aspects of utilizing blockchain and decentralized technologies for any kind of space activities, and ultimately to become a spacefaring civilization. We will present challenges that stem from both socio-economical and technological perspectives, reaching out to experts from both industry and academia to inform the community about their latest work. Meetups will be highly interactive and engage the audience through a combination of activities that are both fun and thought-provoking.
- Add the following tags: Space, NewSpace, Space Tourism, Space Science, Space Exploration, Space Flights, Aerospace Engineering, Blockchain, Ethereum, Decentralized Systems, Astropreneurs
